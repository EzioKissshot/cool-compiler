# Stanford CS143 Compilers Course - COOL Compiler

This repo contain code for my [CS143](https://lagunita.stanford.edu/courses/Engineering/Compilers/Fall2014/about)
classroom.

## Progress

* [ ] Programming Assignment 01
* [ ] Programming Assignment 02
* [ ] Programming Assignment 03
* [ ] Programming Assignment 04

I keep track of my experiences on my [`diary`](diary/) folder.

And you can see code up to some day by looking into this repo tags or going to 
[`/lubien/cool-compiler/tree/day-01`](https://github.com/lubien/cool-compiler/tree/day-01).

## How to use

To attach to the Ubuntu shell:

```sh
Î» docker-compose run cool
```

## Why Docker?

It doesn't run on my Arch Linux setup.

## Can I use your Docker setup?

Of course. I have a git tag named [`boilerplate`](https://github.com/lubien/cool-compiler/tree/boilerplate)
where you can download the minimal Docker setup without any code from my assignments.
